              <p className="sub-heading">
                Definition and Essence of Layer 1 Blockchains
              </p>
              <p>
                Layer 1 blockchains, often referred to as the 'base layer', are
                the foundational level in the blockchain architecture. These
                blockchains execute the fundamental role of transaction
                processing and secure data storage. They achieve this by
                implementing a particular consensus mechanism, which varies from
                blockchain to blockchain - for instance, Bitcoin uses Proof of
                Work (PoW), while Ethereum 2.0 and Trush Network utilize Proof
                of Stake (PoS).
              </p>

              <p>
                Layer 1 protocols include all the core technologies and rules
                implemented at the protocol level, essentially serving as the
                groundwork upon which the entire blockchain is built. They
                encompass everything from transaction validation to the
                formation and addition of new blocks to the blockchain.
