    question: "What is the Trush Network?",
    answer:
      "The Trush Network is a Layer 1 blockchain platform that innovates by combining the Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanisms, supporting a high throughput of 50,000 transactions per second. It prioritizes a user-friendly experience with low fees, high speed, and easy tools for developers, including Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It also places a high emphasis on robust security, simplified smart contract functionality, decentralized governance, unmatched interoperability, and sustainability.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is TRS?",
    answer:
      "TRS is the native token of the Trush ecosystem. With a finite supply of 420 million tokens, TRS is used in staking and consensus, paying transaction fees, participating in network governance, interacting with decentralized applications (dApps), enabling cross-chain interoperability, and incentivizing developers. The Trush network also applies a token burning mechanism to remove a portion of TRS tokens from circulation, which could potentially enhance the long-term value of TRS.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Trush Beacon Consensus (TBC)?",
    answer:
      "The Trush Beacon Consensus (TBC) is a unique consensus mechanism of the Trush Network that combines the Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH) algorithms. This mechanism ensures network performance, sustainability, and secure transaction ordering.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does TRS contribute to network governance?",
    answer:
      "TRS token holders can propose, debate, and vote on network decisions, which fosters a culture of community involvement and shared responsibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Trush Network support cross-chain interoperability?",
    answer:
      "The Trush Network allows for assets, including TRS, to interact with different blockchain ecosystems. This amplifies the utility of TRS, transforming it into a multi-chain asset.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Trush Network incentivize developers?",
    answer:
      "Developers receive TRS tokens as rewards for their contributions to the ecosystem. This approach encourages a vibrant and innovative developer community.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I learn more about Trush?",

  {
    question: "What's the difference between a validator and a delegator in Trush's network?",
    answer:
      "Validators are participants who stake Trush tokens, run a node, validate transactions, and secure the network. Delegators are those who stake their tokens but aren't selected as validators. Instead, they delegate their staking power to a validator, increasing the network's security and stability.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I stake my Trush tokens?",
    answer:
      "Staking can be done through our network wallet. Please follow our staking guide available on the Trush website for detailed instructions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are staking rewards calculated and distributed?",
    answer:
      "Staking rewards are distributed proportionally to validators and their delegators, based on the number of Trush tokens staked. These rewards are given out at the end of each epoch, a fixed time period in Trush's network.",
  },
  {
    question: "What risks are associated with staking Trush tokens?",
    answer:
      "The primary risk associated with staking is potential slashing. If a validator doesn't perform their duties correctly, they may be slashed, losing some of their staked tokens. Additionally, staked tokens are locked and can't be used or sold until the unstaking process is complete.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is 'slashing' in Trush's staking process?",
    answer:
      "Slashing is a penalty applied to validators who act dishonestly or fail to fulfill their duties. If a validator double-signs a block or isn't online when they're expected to be, a portion of their staked tokens might be taken or slashed.",
  },
  {
    question: "When can I unstake my Trush tokens?",
    answer:
      "You can initiate the unstaking process at any time using the Trush Wallet. However, your tokens will remain locked until the end of the current epoch, plus a two-epoch cooling-off period. This is to maintain network stability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I lose all my staked tokens in Trush's network?",
    answer:
      "In case of severe malicious behavior, a validator could potentially lose all their staked tokens due to slashing penalties. However, this would require the validator to repeatedly act against the network's interest.",
