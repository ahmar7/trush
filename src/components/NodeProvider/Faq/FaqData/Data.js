    question: "What is a Node Provider?",
    answer:
      "A Node Provider, often referred to as a validator, is a participant in the Trush network who runs a node. Their role is to validate transactions and secure the network by upholding its rules and protocols.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a regular node and a validator node in the Trush network?",
    answer:
      "In essence, while validator nodes actively engage in block production and transaction validation, regular (delegator) nodes support this process indirectly and help maintain the decentralization and security of the network. The selection of validators in the Trush network is based on a randomized and deterministic approach. Unselected stakers automatically become delegators, supporting the chosen validators.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the technical requirements to become a Node Provider?",
    answer:
      "To become a Node Provider, you need a secure and reliable internet connection, and a server that meets Trush's minimum hardware requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the financial obligations for being a Node Provider?",
    answer:
      "To become a Node Provider, you are required to stake a certain number of TRS tokens as collateral. This acts as an insurance policy to encourage high performance and ethical behavior. The exact number varies and is subject to changes in network parameters.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I become a Node Provider?",
    answer:
      "You can become a Node Provider by submitting an application to join our Node Provider program. Once approved, you will need to meet the collateral requirements by depositing a number of TRS tokens to your Web3 wallet. You then deploy full nodes or archive nodes with the Trush network.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are Node Providers rewarded?",
    answer:
      "Node Providers are rewarded with TRS tokens for their contribution to maintaining the network. These rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch. The exact reward per epoch depends on various factors, including the total number of tokens staked in the network and the number of transactions processed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Node Providers lose their staked tokens?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Node Providers can lose a portion of their staked tokens if they fail to perform their responsibilities correctly or act maliciously against the network, a process known as slashing. However, losing all staked tokens would require a severe and repeated breach of the network's rules.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are some best practices for maintaining the security of my node?",
    answer:
      "Node Providers should always keep their node software up-to-date, use secure and reliable hardware, ensure their internet connection is stable, and never share their private keys. A comprehensive list of security best practices can be found in our wiki.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I get support if I encounter issues as a Node Provider?",
    answer:
      "The Trush community provides several resources for Node Providers who need help or support. These include our official community forum, GitHub repository, and dedicated support team.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I stop being a Node Provider?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can choose to stop being a Node Provider at any time by initiating the unstaking process. However, please note that the tokens will remain locked until the end of the current epoch, plus a cooling-off period of two epochs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my own hardware or should I use Trush's servers?",
    answer:
      "You have the option of either using your own hardware or using Trush's servers. If you decide to use your own hardware, you must ensure that it meets Trush's minimum requirements. Using your own hardware may allow you to maximize your profits. However, Trush's servers automatically meet the benchmark requirements and contribute to the network's decentralization.",
